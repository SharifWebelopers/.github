The Weblopers event is an online educational and competitive event designed for individuals interested in learning and developing web technologies. Participation is free, and no prior programming knowledge is required. 

Participants can register individually or in teams of up to three. The event covers front-end and back-end development using languages and frameworks like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React Js, and Django, with a focus on practical, project-based learning. It offers flexibility in learning schedules, support through social media and a ticketing system, and the opportunity for direct engagement with investors for those in the Idea development phase.
